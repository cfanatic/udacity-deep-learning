    "I have found out that a small learning rate of `lr = 0.001` and a large batch size of `batch_size = 512` made the model converge the fastest. I had to try a number of different values for the batch size to get the model to train properly. I have started with a value of 50, but training turned out to be too slow in this range. I decided to choose a sequence length of `sequence_length = 5`, because the average number of words per line is `5.544` according to the dataset statistics in the beginning of this project. I felt there was no need to go with a higher value, since I wanted to generate a script that has similar complexity as the original content. Since the dictionary contains a number of 21387 unique words, I chose a value of `embedding_dim = 200` for the embedding dimension. This is based on my experience of previous RNN implementations. For the number of hidden features, `hidden_dim = 400` turned out to be a good value to achieve enough learning capacity. I wanted to balance model performance vs. training time. In order to keep training time low, I set the number of LSTM layers to `n_layers = 2`."
